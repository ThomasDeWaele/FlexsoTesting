# Technical Specification: Integration Flow in SAP Cloud Integration

This document details the technical specifications for the integration flow developed in SAP Cloud Integration, encompassing several interconnected processes.

## Process Overview

The integration flow orchestrates data from SuccessFactors (SFSF), SAP ERP, and potentially a mock system, transforming and enriching it before transferring it to Concur via SFTP.  The flow consists of several subprocesses:

* **XML to CSV:** Transforms XML data into CSV format.
* **Start from ProcessDirect:** Initiates the main process via ProcessDirect.
* **Scheduler:** Initiates the main process via a timer.
* **Get Vendors from SAP ERP:** Retrieves vendor data from SAP ERP.
* **Main Process:** The core process encompassing data retrieval, transformation, enrichment, encryption (optional), and SFTP transfer.
* **Enrich from SFSF:** Enriches employee data from SFSF.
* **Get Employees from SFSF:** Retrieves employee data from SFSF.

## Integration Flow Initiation

The integration flow can be initiated in two ways:

1. **ProcessDirect:** The `Start from ProcessDirect` process uses a `ProcessDirect` sender adapter named "ProcessDirect" to trigger the main process. This allows external systems to initiate the integration flow directly.

2. **Timer:** The `Scheduler` process uses a timer event (`Start Timer 1`) to schedule periodic execution of the main process. This enables automated, recurring data synchronization.


## Detailed Process Description

### 1. Get Employees from SFSF (`Get Employees from SFSF` Process)

This process retrieves employee data from SuccessFactors.

* **Start 1:** The process starts with a timer event.
* **GetEmployees:** A SuccessFactors API call is made to the `SFSF_SOAP` receiver to retrieve employee data.  This step uses the SuccessFactors adapter.
* **Test Employees:** A SuccessFactors API call is made to the `SFSF_Test` receiver. The purpose of this call is not explicitly stated in the XML but likely for testing purposes. This step also uses the SuccessFactors adapter.
* **End 1:** The process ends after successful execution of API calls.

### 2. Enrich from SFSF (`Enrich from SFSF` Process)

This process enriches the employee data retrieved from SuccessFactors.

* **Start 2:** The process starts with a start event.
* **Enrich FOCompany:** An API call (details not specified in XML) is made to enrich the data with `FOCompany` information. The adapter type is not specified.
* **Enrich person_id_ext for relation:** An API call is made to enrich the data with  `person_id_ext` information for establishing relationships. The adapter type is not specified.
* **End 2:** The process ends after successful enrichment.

### 3. Get Vendors from SAP ERP (`Get Vendors from SAP ERP` Process)

This process retrieves vendor data from SAP ERP.

* **Start 3:** The process begins with a start event.
* **Remove XML Declaration:** Removes the XML declaration from the input XML.  This is a pre-processing step.
* **Generate Request GetVendorId:** Generates a request to retrieve Vendor IDs. This step likely involves transforming the data to a format suitable for the SAP ERP API call.
* **Save XML:**  Saves the input XML to a variable named `employeeXML`. This is a content modifier step.
  * **ContentModifier Properties:**
    | Name          | Action | Type     | Value             | Default | Datatype |
    |-----------------|--------|----------|--------------------|---------|-----------|
    | employeeXML    | Create  | expression | `${in.body}`       |         |           |


* **GetVendors:** A SOAP API call is made to the `SAP_ERP` receiver to retrieve vendor data.  This step uses the SOAP adapter. Uses API credential `{{ECC_CRED}}`.
* **GetVendorMock:** A SOAP API call is made to a `Mock` receiver â€“ likely for testing purposes. This step uses the SOAP adapter.
* **Combine Vendors & Employees:** Combines the retrieved vendor data with the employee data.  This step likely involves joining data based on a common key.
* **Filter:** Filters the combined data based on unspecified criteria.
* **Merge Vendors & Employees:** Merges the employee and vendor data.  The specific merging logic isn't defined in the XML.
* **End 3:** The process ends after successful retrieval and merging of data.


### 4. XML to CSV (`XML to CSV` Process)

This process transforms XML data into CSV format.

* **Start 4:** The process starts with a start event.
* **XML to CSV Header:** Transforms the header section of the XML data into CSV format. This involves extracting header information and structuring it appropriately for CSV.
* **XML to CSV Employee:** Transforms the employee data section of the XML into CSV format.  This likely involves field mapping and data transformation.
* **XML to CSV Delegate:** Transforms the delegate data section of the XML into CSV format. This likely involves field mapping and data transformation.
* **Set empty body:** Sets the message body to empty. The purpose is not explicitly stated in the XML but likely for preparing the message before the next step.
* **Gather 1:** Gathers the transformed CSV data from the previous steps (`XML to CSV Header`, `XML to CSV Employee`, and `XML to CSV Delegate`) into a single message.
* **End 4:** The process ends after successful CSV transformation.


### 5. Main Process (`Main Process` Process)

This process is the core of the integration flow.

* **Start 6:** The process begins with a start event.
* **Get Employees from SFSF:** Calls the `Get Employees from SFSF` subprocess to retrieve employee data from SFSF.
* **Remove nodes without Person:** Removes nodes from the XML that do not contain "Person" data.
* **Filter current nodes:** Filters the remaining XML nodes based on unspecified criteria.
* **Keep newest employment:** Selects only the newest employment record for each employee.
* **Remove employees with company code C628 and country code not Norway:** Filters out employees based on company code and country code.
* **Remove incomplete Employees:** Removes employees with incomplete data.
* **Remove unpaid leave employees:** Removes employees on unpaid leave.
* **Remove employment_information and job_information with lower fte:** Removes employment and job information for employees with lower FTE (full-time equivalent).
* **Set Highest Direct Reports:** Sets the highest direct reports for each employee.
* **Employee SF to Concur:** Prepares the employee data for sending to Concur. This step involves data transformation and potentially formatting.
* **Get Vendors from SAP ERP:** Calls the `Get Vendors from SAP ERP` subprocess to retrieve vendor data from SAP ERP.
* **XML to CSV:** Calls the `XML to CSV` subprocess to transform the prepared data into CSV format.
* **AddBOM:** Adds a Bill of Materials (BOM) - the purpose is not explicitly stated but likely for enriching the data.
* **Router 1:** Routes the message based on the value of the `skipEncryption` property.
    * If `${property.skipEncryption} = 'true'`, it routes to `Skip encryption for testing`.
    * Otherwise, it routes to `PGPEncryptor 1`.
* **PGPEncryptor 1:** Encrypts the message using PGP encryption.
* **Skip encryption for testing:** Skips encryption (for testing purposes).
* **Log Msg:** Logs a message.  The specific log message is not detailed.
* **Concur SFTP:** Transfers the processed data to Concur via SFTP. This step utilizes the SFTP adapter and targets the `Concur_SFTP` receiver.
* **End 6:** The process ends after successful data transfer.


### 6. Start from ProcessDirect (`Start from ProcessDirect` Process)
