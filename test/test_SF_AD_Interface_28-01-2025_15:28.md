## Process Overview

This document provides a technical specification for the integration flows described in the XML file. It outlines the processes involved, how they are initiated, and a detailed description of each step within these processes. This document aims to provide a clear understanding of the integration logic for new project members.

The integration solution consists of the following processes:

| Process Name                      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration Process               | The main integration flow, responsible for orchestrating user data processing. |
| Local Integration Process All Users | A sub-process to fetch and process all users.                              |
| Local Integration Process Selected Users | A sub-process to fetch and process a selected group of users.            |
| Process Employee                  | A sub-process to handle the processing of individual employee data.        |
| Read LastRun                      | A sub-process to read the timestamp of the last successful run.             |
| Write LastRun                     | A sub-process to write the timestamp of the current run.                    |
| Invalid Log                       | A sub-process to handle and log invalid data entries.                       |
| Log                               | A sub-process for logging information, sending emails and SFTP logs.       |
| Extract Error Process             | A sub-process to extract and log error details.                             |

## Integration Flow Initiation

The main integration flow, **Integration Process**, is initiated by a **Start Timer** event. This means the integration flow is scheduled to run automatically based on a configured timer schedule within SAP Cloud Integration.

## Detailed Process Description

### Process: Integration Process

This is the main integration flow that orchestrates the entire user data processing. It starts with a timer, reads the last run timestamp, configures flow properties, processes users based on configuration (all or selected), handles invalid entries, writes the current run timestamp, and then ends.

```
Start Timer --> Read LastRun --> Configure Flow --> Router - all / selected users --> [Selected Employees: Process Call - Selected Users] / [All Employees: Looping Process Call - All Users] --> Router - Log Invalid Entries --> [Invalid Entries: Invalid Log] --> Write LastRun --> End
                                                                                                      ^
                                                                                                      |
                                                                                                [No Invalid Entries]
```

#### Step: Start Timer (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Integration Process** flow based on a pre-defined timer schedule in SAP Cloud Integration. There are no specific configurations within this step as the scheduling is managed at the integration flow level.

#### Step: Read LastRun (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Read LastRun** local process. This sub-process is responsible for retrieving the timestamp of the last successful execution of the integration flow. This information can be used for delta load scenarios or tracking purposes.

* **Called Process:** Read LastRun

#### Step: Configure Flow (ContentModifier)

This step sets various properties that are used throughout the integration flow. These properties are configured using constants, likely referencing parameters defined at the integration flow level, allowing for easy configuration changes without modifying the flow logic directly.

| Property Name           | Action   | Type     | Value                           | Datatype        |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| RolesToExclude          | Create   | constant | {{Roles_To_Exclude}}            |                 |
| queryusernames          | Create   | constant | {{SF_Query_usernames}}            |                 |
| processDirectUrl        | Create   | constant | {{ProcessDirect_Url}}           |                 |
| debuggingEnabled        | Create   | constant | {{Debugging_Enabled}}           |                 |
| emailFrom               | Create   | constant | {{Email_From}}                  |                 |
| EmailNotificationsEnabled | Create   | constant | {{Email_Notifications_Enabled}} |                 |
| SFTPLoggingEnabled      | Create   | constant | {{SFTP_Logging_Enabled}}        |                 |
| emailRecipients         | Create   | constant | {{Email_Recipients}}            |                 |
| processAllEmployees     | Create   | constant | {{All_Employees}}               |                 |

#### Step: Router - all / selected users (router)

This step acts as a decision point, routing the flow based on the `processAllEmployees` property set in the "Configure Flow" step.

* **Condition: All Employees**: `${property.processAllEmployees} = 'true'`
    - If the `processAllEmployees` property is set to 'true', the flow proceeds to the "Looping Process Call - All Users" step. This indicates processing data for all employees.
* **Condition: Selected Employees**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If the `processAllEmployees` property is not 'true' (default case), the flow proceeds to the "Process Call - Selected Users" step. This indicates processing data for a selected group of employees.

#### Step: Looping Process Call - All Users (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Local Looping Integration Process All Users** local process. This sub-process is responsible for fetching and processing data for all users, likely in batches or loops to handle large datasets.

* **Called Process:** Local Looping Integration Process All Users

#### Step: Process Call - Selected Users (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Local Integration Process Selected Users** local process. This sub-process is responsible for fetching and processing data for a specific selection of users, likely based on usernames provided in a configuration.

* **Called Process:** Local Integration Process Selected Users

#### Step: Router - Log Invalid Entries (router)

This step checks for invalid entries in the processed data. It likely evaluates an XML structure (presumably within the message body) for errors.

* **Condition: Invalid Entries**: `count(/root/error) > 0`
    - If the XPath expression `count(/root/error) > 0` evaluates to true (meaning there are error elements under the `/root/error` path), the flow proceeds to the "Invalid Log" step.
* **Condition: No Invalid Entries**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If there are no invalid entries (default case), the flow proceeds directly to the "Write LastRun" step.

#### Step: Invalid Log (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Invalid Log** local process. This sub-process is responsible for handling and logging any invalid data entries identified in the previous routing step. This might involve storing the invalid data for analysis or correction.

* **Called Process:** Invalid Log

#### Step: Write LastRun (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Write LastRun** local process. This sub-process updates the timestamp of the last successful run, typically after the main processing is completed without critical errors. This ensures that the next run can potentially leverage this timestamp for delta processing or monitoring.

* **Called Process:** Write LastRun

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the successful completion of the **Integration Process** flow.

---

### Process: Local Integration Process Selected Users

This process retrieves and processes data for selected users. It interacts with SuccessFactors to fetch user data, filters and processes it, and handles empty results.

```
Start --> Request Reply - SF --> Router - Empty Result --> [Valid result: Process Call - Process Employees] / [Empty result: End] --> Filter --> Save Body --> Set Body --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Local Integration Process Selected Users** sub-process.

#### Step: Request Reply - SF (API_CALL)

This step calls a 3rd party system, **SuccessFactors (SF)**, to retrieve user data. It uses the **SuccessFactorsODataSingleUser** adapter to connect to SF and likely queries user data based on pre-configured selection criteria or usernames passed to this process.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System
* **Adapter:** SuccessFactorsODataSingleUser
* **Receiver:** SF
* **3rd Party System:** SuccessFactors

#### Step: Router - Empty Result (router)

This step checks if the response from SuccessFactors contains user data.

* **Condition: Empty result**: `not(//User/User/node())`
    - If the XPath expression `not(//User/User/node())` evaluates to true (meaning no user nodes are found under `/User/User`), it indicates no users were returned from SuccessFactors. The flow proceeds to the "End" step, signifying no further processing is needed for selected users in this case.
* **Condition: Valid result**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If users are returned from SuccessFactors (default case), the flow proceeds to the "Process Call - Process Employees" step to process the retrieved user data.

#### Step: Process Call - Process Employees (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Process Employee** local process for each user retrieved from SuccessFactors. This sub-process handles the individual processing logic for each employee.

* **Called Process:** Process Employee

#### Step: Filter (Step with no specific type in XML - Assuming Filter step)

This step is present in the flow but lacks a defined type and ContentModifier details in the XML. Assuming it's a filter step, it likely performs some data filtering operation on the user data received from the "Process Employees" sub-process or before calling it. **Further clarification is needed to understand the exact purpose of this step.**

#### Step: Save Body (ContentModifier)

This step uses a Content Modifier to accumulate the message body. It appends the current message body to a property named `savedBody`. This suggests it might be aggregating data from multiple iterations of a previous step or preparing data for a later aggregation or processing step.

| Property Name | Action   | Type       | Value                     | Datatype        |
|---------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| savedBody     | Create   | expression | `${property.savedBody}${body}` | java.lang.String |

#### Step: Set Body (Step with no specific type in XML - Assuming ContentModifier with no properties)

This step is present in the flow but lacks a defined type and ContentModifier details in the XML. It's named "Set Body" but has no configuration. It might be intended to be a Content Modifier step to set or modify the body but is currently unconfigured or its intended functionality is not defined by the XML. **Further clarification is needed to understand the exact purpose of this step.**

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Local Integration Process Selected Users** sub-process.

---

### Process: Local Looping Integration Process All Users

This process retrieves and processes data for all users, similar to the "Selected Users" process but designed for fetching all users from SuccessFactors.

```
Start --> Request Reply - SF All users --> Router - Empty Result --> [Valid result: Process Call - Process Employees] / [Empty result: End] --> Filter --> Save Body --> Set Body --> End
```

This process shares a similar structure to "Local Integration Process Selected Users", with the key difference being the "Request Reply - SF All users" step which fetches all user data. Steps like "Filter", "Save Body", and "Set Body" are present and require similar clarification as in the "Selected Users" process due to missing type and configuration details in the XML for "Filter" and "Set Body".

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Local Looping Integration Process All Users** sub-process.

#### Step: Request Reply - SF All users (API_CALL)

This step calls a 3rd party system, **SuccessFactors (SF)**, to retrieve data for all users. It uses the **SuccessFactorsODataAllUsers** adapter to connect to SF and likely performs a query to fetch all user records.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System
* **Adapter:** SuccessFactorsODataAllUsers
* **Receiver:** SF
* **3rd Party System:** SuccessFactors

#### Step: Router - Empty Result (router)

This step checks if the response from SuccessFactors contains user data. The condition is identical to the "Router - Empty Result" in "Local Integration Process Selected Users".

* **Condition: Empty result**: `not(//User/User/node())`
    - If no users are returned, the flow ends.
* **Condition: Valid result**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If users are returned, the flow proceeds to "Process Call - Process Employees".

#### Step: Process Call - Process Employees (CallLocalProcess)

This step, similar to the "Selected Users" process, calls the **Process Employee** local process for each user.

* **Called Process:** Process Employee

#### Step: Filter, Save Body, Set Body, End (Refer to descriptions in "Local Integration Process Selected Users")

These steps function similarly to their counterparts in the "Local Integration Process Selected Users" process and require the same clarifications regarding the "Filter" and "Set Body" steps due to missing type and configuration in the XML.

### Process: Process Employee

This process handles the individual processing of employee data. It performs message mapping, XSLT transformations, interacts with another system via ProcessDirect, and includes debugging and logging capabilities.

```
Start --> Message Mapping - filter dates --> XSLT Mapping - exclude filter_roles --> XSLT Mapping - append roles --> Splitter --> Content Modifier - username, firstName, lastName, statute --> Request Reply --> Gather --> Router  debug --> [Yes: Send] / [No: End] --> XSLT Mapping - append filter_username, filter_firstName, filter_lastName, filter_statute --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Process Employee** sub-process.

#### Step: Message Mapping - filter dates (MessageMapping)

This step performs a message mapping using the resource **MM_SFSF_Filter_Nodes_Dates**. Message Mapping is used to transform the structure of the message payload, in this case, likely filtering or modifying date-related nodes in the employee data received from SuccessFactors.

* **Mapping Resource:** MM_SFSF_Filter_Nodes_Dates

#### Step: XSLT Mapping - exclude filter_roles (XSLTMapping)

This step performs an XSLT transformation using the script **excludefilter_roles**. This XSLT script likely removes or excludes roles from the employee data based on configured filter criteria.

* **XSLT Script Resource:** excludefilter_roles

#### Step: XSLT Mapping - append roles (XSLTMapping)

This step performs an XSLT transformation using the script **append_roles**. This XSLT script likely adds or appends roles to the employee data, potentially based on configurations or lookups.

* **XSLT Script Resource:** append_roles

#### Step: Splitter (Step with no specific type in XML - Assuming a General Splitter)

This step is present but lacks a defined type in the XML. Assuming it's a splitter, it likely splits the incoming message into multiple messages, potentially based on elements within the employee data (e.g., splitting user data into individual attributes for further processing). **Further clarification is needed to confirm the splitter type and its splitting criteria.**

#### Step: Content Modifier - username, firstName, lastName, statute (Step with no ContentModifier details in XML - Assuming it sets these as properties, but details are missing)

This step is named to suggest it sets properties related to username, first name, last name, and statute. However, the XML lacks `ContentModifier` details for this step, meaning the exact properties being set and their values are not defined in the provided XML. **Further clarification is needed to understand the properties set in this Content Modifier.**

#### Step: Request Reply (API_CALL)

This step calls a 3rd party system using the **ProcessDirect-EDS-AzureAD** adapter and **Receiver-ProcessDirect-EDS-AzureAD** receiver. **ProcessDirect** adapter in SAP Cloud Integration is typically used for synchronous communication between integration flows or components within the same tenant. In this context, it likely calls another integration flow or a component that interfaces with **Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)**, based on the receiver name.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System (Likely ProcessDirect internal call to Azure AD interface)
* **Adapter:** ProcessDirect-EDS-AzureAD
* **Receiver:** Receiver-ProcessDirect-EDS-AzureAD
* **3rd Party System:** Azure AD (Indirectly via ProcessDirect)

#### Step: Gather (Step with no specific type in XML - Assuming a Gather step to aggregate messages)

This step is present but lacks a defined type in the XML. Assuming it's a Gather step, it likely aggregates messages that were split earlier by the "Splitter" step. It collects the processed individual messages back into a single message for subsequent steps. **Further clarification is needed to confirm if it's a Gather step and its aggregation strategy.**

#### Step: Router  debug (router)

This step acts as a decision point based on the `debuggingEnabled` property.

* **Condition: Yes**: `${property.debuggingEnabled} = 'true'`
    - If `debuggingEnabled` is 'true', the flow proceeds to the "Send" step, enabling debug logging or sending debug information to a designated system.
* **Condition: No**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If `debuggingEnabled` is not 'true' (default case), the flow proceeds to the "End" step, skipping debug-related actions.

#### Step: Send (API_CALL)

This step is executed only when debugging is enabled. It calls a 3rd party system using the **SFTP-Process-Employee-InvalidADUsers** adapter and **SFTP-Log** receiver. This indicates that when debugging is active, invalid or specific employee data is sent to an **SFTP server (SFTP-Log)** for logging or analysis purposes.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System
* **Adapter:** SFTP-Process-Employee-InvalidADUsers
* **Receiver:** SFTP-Log
* **3rd Party System:** SFTP Server

#### Step: XSLT Mapping - append filter_username, filter_firstName, filter_lastName, filter_statute (XSLTMapping)

This step performs an XSLT transformation using the script **appendfilter_username**. This XSLT script likely appends filter criteria (username, first name, last name, statute) to the employee data. This might be for logging or audit purposes, recording the filters applied during processing.

* **XSLT Script Resource:** appendfilter_username

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Process Employee** sub-process.

---

### Process: Read LastRun

This process is designed to read the timestamp of the last successful integration run.

```
Start --> Content Modifier --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Read LastRun** sub-process.

#### Step: Content Modifier (Step with no ContentModifier details in XML - Assuming it retrieves the last run timestamp, but details missing)

This step is a Content Modifier but lacks `ContentModifier` details in the XML. It is intended to retrieve the timestamp of the last successful run. It likely reads this timestamp from a persistent store (e.g., Data Store in SAP Cloud Integration) and sets it as a property or in the message body. **Further clarification is needed to understand how it retrieves and sets the last run timestamp.**

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Read LastRun** sub-process.

---

### Process: Write LastRun

This process is designed to write the timestamp of the current integration run.

```
Start --> Content Modifier --> Write LastSync --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Write LastRun** sub-process.

#### Step: Content Modifier (ContentModifier)

This step creates a property named `thisRun` and sets its value to the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX).

| Property Name | Action   | Type       | Value                                   | Datatype        |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| thisRun       | Create   | expression | `${date:now:YYYY-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX}` |                 |

#### Step: Write LastSync (Step with no specific type in XML - Assuming a Data Store Write operation)

This step is present but lacks a defined type in the XML. Named "Write LastSync", it likely writes the `thisRun` timestamp (created in the previous step) to a persistent store, such as a Data Store in SAP Cloud Integration. This store is then used by the "Read LastRun" process to retrieve the last successful run timestamp. **Further clarification is needed to confirm if it's a Data Store Write and the target Data Store.**

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Write LastRun** sub-process.

---

### Process: Invalid Log

This process handles and logs invalid data entries.

```
Start --> Content Modifier --> XSLT Mapping Invalid entries --> Process Call - Log --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Invalid Log** sub-process.

#### Step: Content Modifier (ContentModifier)

This step creates a property named `filename` and sets its value to a dynamic filename based on the current date in the format `invalid_yyyyMMdd.xml`.

| Property Name | Action   | Type       | Value                       | Datatype        |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| filename      | Create   | expression | `invalid_${date:now:yyyyMMdd}.xml` |                 |

#### Step: XSLT Mapping Invalid entries (XSLTMapping)

This step performs an XSLT transformation using the script **xmlinvalidlogging**. This script likely transforms the invalid data into a specific XML format suitable for logging or further processing.

* **XSLT Script Resource:** xmlinvalidlogging

#### Step: Process Call - Log (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Log** local process to handle the actual logging of the invalid data, likely using the transformed XML from the previous step and the dynamically generated filename.

* **Called Process:** Log

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Invalid Log** sub-process.

---

### Process: Log

This process handles logging through email notifications and SFTP.

```
Start --> Content Modifier --> Mail --> [Yes: Send Mail] / [No: End] --> SFTP --> [Yes: Send SFTP] / [No: End] --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Log** sub-process.

#### Step: Content Modifier (ContentModifier)

This step extracts information from the message body (presumably in XML format under a root element `mailOutput`) to set properties for email notifications. It extracts the sender (`mail_from`), title (`mail_title`), recipients (`mail_to`), and body (`mail_body`) from the XML structure.

| Property Name | Action   | Type   | Value                     | Datatype        |
|---------------|----------|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| mail_from     | Create   | xpath  | `/mailOutput/from/text()`   | java.lang.String |
| mail_title    | Create   | xpath  | `/mailOutput/title/text()`  | java.lang.String |
| mail_to       | Create   | xpath  | `/mailOutput/recipients/text()` | java.lang.String |
| mail_body     | Create   | xpath  | `/mailOutput/body/text()`   | java.lang.String |

#### Step: Mail (router)

This step routes the flow based on the `EmailNotificationsEnabled` property.

* **Condition: Yes**: `${property.EmailNotificationsEnabled} = 'true'`
    - If `EmailNotificationsEnabled` is 'true', the flow proceeds to the "Send Mail" step, enabling email notifications.
* **Condition: No**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If `EmailNotificationsEnabled` is not 'true' (default case), the flow skips email notifications and proceeds to the "SFTP" step.

#### Step: SFTP (router)

This step routes the flow based on the `SFTPLoggingEnabled` property.

* **Condition: Yes**: `${property.SFTPLoggingEnabled} = 'true'`
    - If `SFTPLoggingEnabled` is 'true', the flow proceeds to the "Send SFTP" step, enabling SFTP logging.
* **Condition: No**: `DefaultExpression`
    - If `SFTPLoggingEnabled` is not 'true' (default case), the flow skips SFTP logging and proceeds to the "End" step.

#### Step: Send Mail (API_CALL)

This step is executed if email notifications are enabled. It calls a 3rd party system using the **Mail-Exceptions** adapter and **Receiver-Email** receiver to send an email.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System
* **Adapter:** Mail-Exceptions
* **Receiver:** Receiver-Email
* **3rd Party System:** Email Server (configured via 'Receiver-Email')

#### Step: Send SFTP (API_CALL)

This step is executed if SFTP logging is enabled. It calls a 3rd party system using the **SFTP-Error** adapter and **SFTP-Log** receiver to send log files to an SFTP server.

* **Type:** API Call to 3rd Party System
* **Adapter:** SFTP-Error
* **Receiver:** SFTP-Log
* **3rd Party System:** SFTP Server (configured via 'SFTP-Log')

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Log** sub-process.

---

### Process: Extract Error Process

This process extracts error details (exception message and stacktrace) and logs them.

```
Start --> CM - filename / stacktrace --> XSLT Mapping Exception --> Process Call - Log --> End
```

#### Step: Start (StartEvent)

This step initiates the **Extract Error Process** sub-process.

#### Step: CM - filename / stacktrace (ContentModifier)

This step creates properties to store the exception message, stacktrace, and a dynamic filename for error logging.

| Property Name             | Action   | Type       | Value                                    | Datatype        |
|---------------------------|----------|------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| exception_message_to_escape | Create   | expression | `exception.message`                      | java.lang.String |
| filename                  | Create   | expression | `general_error_${date:now:yyyyMMdd}.xml` |                 |
| exception_to_escape       | Create   | expression | `exception.stacktrace`                   | java.lang.String |

#### Step: XSLT Mapping Exception (XSLTMapping)

This step performs an XSLT transformation using the script **Exception**. This script likely formats the exception message and stacktrace into a structured XML format for logging.

* **XSLT Script Resource:** Exception

#### Step: Process Call - Log (CallLocalProcess)

This step calls the **Log** local process to handle the actual logging of the extracted error information, using the transformed XML from the previous step and the generated filename.

* **Called Process:** Log

#### Step: End (endEvent)

This step marks the completion of the **Extract Error Process** sub-process.
